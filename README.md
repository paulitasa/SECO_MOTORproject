# SECO_MOTORproject
Project for the subject SECO (ELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEMS). 
Modeling and controller (proportional and derivative) of a motor

## E2
First delivery of the project including:
* Control of the input signals of a DC motor by pulse width modulation (PWM) and reading of the information obtained by the encoder of the motor. 
* Obtaining samples of the angular position of a disk attached to a gearbox, in order to experimentally model the motor. 
* Proportional and derivative controllers that allow to take the motor to a desired position.

## E3
Second delivery of the project including:
* Design of the parameters needed to meet a set of specifications for PID-D control.
* Theoretical simulation of the controller.
